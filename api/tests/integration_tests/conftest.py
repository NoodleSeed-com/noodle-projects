# This file can be removed since we now use centralized fixtures
# Keep it temporarily for reference, but it should be deleted when migration is complete

# IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE THIS FILE FOR NEW TESTS
# Use the fixtures from api/tests/fixtures/ instead

# Legacy fixtures have been migrated to:
# - event_loop: api/tests/fixtures/db.py
# - preserve_environment: api/tests/fixtures/env.py
# - temp_template_dir: api/tests/fixtures/fs.py
# - test_engine: api/tests/fixtures/db.py
# - async_session_factory: api/tests/fixtures/db.py
# - db_session: api/tests/fixtures/db.py
# - TestOpenRouterService: api/tests/fixtures/mocks.py
# - client: api/tests/fixtures/client.py
# - test_project, test_version, test_files: api/tests/fixtures/client.py (via create_payload)
