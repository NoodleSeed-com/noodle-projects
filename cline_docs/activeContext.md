# Active Context

## Current State (Updated 2024-02-24 08:10 PST)
Successfully fixed test_project_soft_delete and documented SQLAlchemy testing patterns.

### Recent Test Fixes
1. test_latest_version_number:
   - Fixed by ensuring proper session handling
   - Added version_number to avoid unique constraint violation
   - Added refresh after commit to load relationships

2. test_project_soft_delete:
   - Fixed by using commit() instead of flush() for event triggers
   - Added explicit version numbering to avoid conflicts
   - Added proper session refresh points
   - Verified cascading soft delete behavior

### Key Learnings
1. SQLAlchemy Session Management:
   - Use commit() to trigger after_insert events
   - Refresh objects after commit to load relationships
   - Handle unique constraints explicitly
   - Maintain proper transaction boundaries

2. Version Number Management:
   - Version 0 is reserved for initial version
   - Use explicit numbering for additional versions
   - Handle unique constraint (project_id, version_number)
   - Consider version number sequence in tests

## Test Organization Progress

1. Completed Changes:
   - Renamed ProjectVersion to Version throughout codebase
   - Updated imports to reflect new naming
   - Reorganized tests to be co-located with source code:
     ```
     api/app/
     ├── models/tests/        # Database model tests
     ├── routes/tests/        # API endpoint tests
     └── services/tests/      # Service tests
     ```

2. Current Issues:
   - Database test setup failing due to foreign key constraints
   - Error: "cannot drop table projects because other objects depend on it"
   - Need to implement proper cascade deletion in test database setup

3. Next Steps:
   - Implement proper database cleanup in test fixtures
   - Consider using transaction rollbacks for test isolation
   - Add CASCADE option for foreign key constraints
   - Review test database setup patterns

## Test Coverage Status
Current coverage report shows:
- Overall coverage: 11%
- Models coverage varies:
  * base.py: 100%
  * file.py: 57%
  * project.py: 93%
  * version.py: 77%
- Most modules need significant test coverage improvement

## Active Decisions

### Test Database Setup
1. Current Approach:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
   def test_db(test_engine):
       Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=test_engine)
       Base.metadata.create_all(bind=test_engine)
       TestingSessionLocal = sessionmaker(...)
       db = TestingSessionLocal()
       yield db
       db.close()
       Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=test_engine)
   ```

2. Issues to Address:
   - Foreign key constraints preventing table cleanup
   - Need for proper transaction management
   - Test isolation requirements
   - Database state management between tests

### Test Organization Pattern
1. Co-location Benefits:
   - Better discoverability
   - Clear ownership
   - Improved maintainability
   - Easier navigation
   - Direct context

2. Implementation Status:
   - ✅ Models tests moved to models/tests/
   - ✅ Routes tests moved to routes/tests/
   - ✅ Services tests moved to services/tests/
   - ✅ Test files renamed for clarity
   - ✅ Conftest.py files properly distributed

## Recent Changes

### Test Reorganization (2024-02-24 07:20 PST)
- Moved tests closer to implementation code
- Created dedicated test directories per module
- Updated imports and dependencies
- Renamed ProjectVersion to Version
- Identified database test setup issues

### Version Model Updates (2024-02-24 07:00 PST)
- Renamed ProjectVersion class to Version
- Updated all references to use new name
- Maintained existing functionality
- Preserved database schema

## Current Test Status (Updated 2024-02-24 09:36 PST)

### Test Progress
1. Fixed Tests:
   - ✅ test_file_creation
   - ✅ test_file_path_constraints
   - ✅ test_file_content_constraints
   - ✅ test_file_timestamps
   - ✅ test_project_soft_delete
   - ✅ test_latest_version_number
   - ✅ test_project_constraints
   - ✅ test_project_relationships (updated to use soft delete)
   - ✅ test_version_file_constraints (updated to expect ValueError)

2. Remaining Issues:
   - test_version_validation failing with IntegrityError
   - Root cause: Version number defaulting to 0 when testing inactive project validation
   - Need to set explicit version number even though test will fail with ValueError first

### Key Findings
1. Validation Hierarchy:
   - Python-level validation in __init__:
     * Empty paths (ValueError)
     * Null content (ValueError)
     * Project active state (ValueError)
   - Database-level constraints:
     * Unique version numbers (IntegrityError)
     * Foreign key relationships (IntegrityError)

2. Test Patterns:
   - Use commit() instead of flush() to trigger events
   - Set explicit version numbers to avoid conflicts
   - Test both Python and DB validations
   - Refresh objects after commits

3. Documentation Updates:
   - ✅ Added SQLAlchemy testing patterns
   - ✅ Added Version Management patterns
   - ✅ Documented validation hierarchy
   - ✅ Added test patterns and examples

## Next Steps
1. Future test improvements:
   - Update test_version_validation to set version number
   - Add more test cases for validation edge cases
   - Consider adding property-based tests
   - Add performance tests for large version trees

2. Documentation tasks:
   - ✅ Updated systemPatterns.md with validation patterns
   - ✅ Added test examples and code snippets
   - ✅ Documented common pitfalls
   - ✅ Added version management lessons
