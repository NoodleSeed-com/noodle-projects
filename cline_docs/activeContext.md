# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### File Support in Project Versions
- Implemented file storage and retrieval in project versions
- Added file response DTOs and updated version responses
- Implemented eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Added comprehensive tests for file functionality

## Recent Changes

1. API Response Structure:
   - Added files array to version responses
   - Implemented FileResponse DTO
   - Updated ProjectVersionResponse to include files

2. Database Operations:
   - Using eager loading for file relationships
   - Maintaining proper cascade relationships
   - Ensuring data integrity with constraints

3. Testing:
   - Reorganized tests into focused categories:
     * CRUD operations (test_crud.py)
     * Input validation (test_validation.py)
     * Version management (test_versions.py)
     * File handling (test_files.py)
   - Centralized fixtures in conftest.py
   - Maintained 93% test coverage
   - All 17 tests passing

## Active Decisions

1. File Storage:
   - Files are immutable per version
   - Files are always associated with versions
   - File paths are relative to project root

2. Response Structure:
   - Detailed responses include full file content
   - List responses exclude files for efficiency
   - Using DTOs to maintain clean separation

## Next Steps

1. Potential Improvements:
   - Add file content validation
   - Implement file type detection
   - Add file size limits
   - Consider file content compression

2. Future Considerations:
   - File diff functionality between versions
   - File metadata support
   - Binary file handling
   - Large file optimization

## Current CLI Operations
- Tests run with: `cd api && pytest tests/test_projects/ -v`
- Coverage check: `pytest --cov=api/app api/tests/ -v`
- All tests passing with 93% coverage
