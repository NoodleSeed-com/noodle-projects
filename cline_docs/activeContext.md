# Active Context

## Current State (Updated 2024-02-24 07:20 PST)
Working on test organization and database test setup improvements.

## Test Organization Progress

1. Completed Changes:
   - Renamed ProjectVersion to Version throughout codebase
   - Updated imports to reflect new naming
   - Reorganized tests to be co-located with source code:
     ```
     api/app/
     ├── models/tests/        # Database model tests
     ├── routes/tests/        # API endpoint tests
     └── services/tests/      # Service tests
     ```

2. Current Issues:
   - Database test setup failing due to foreign key constraints
   - Error: "cannot drop table projects because other objects depend on it"
   - Need to implement proper cascade deletion in test database setup

3. Next Steps:
   - Implement proper database cleanup in test fixtures
   - Consider using transaction rollbacks for test isolation
   - Add CASCADE option for foreign key constraints
   - Review test database setup patterns

## Test Coverage Status
Current coverage report shows:
- Overall coverage: 8%
- Models coverage varies:
  * base.py: 100%
  * file.py: 57%
  * project.py: 93%
  * version.py: 77%
- Most modules need significant test coverage improvement

## Active Decisions

### Test Database Setup
1. Current Approach:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
   def test_db(test_engine):
       Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=test_engine)
       Base.metadata.create_all(bind=test_engine)
       TestingSessionLocal = sessionmaker(...)
       db = TestingSessionLocal()
       yield db
       db.close()
       Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=test_engine)
   ```

2. Issues to Address:
   - Foreign key constraints preventing table cleanup
   - Need for proper transaction management
   - Test isolation requirements
   - Database state management between tests

### Test Organization Pattern
1. Co-location Benefits:
   - Better discoverability
   - Clear ownership
   - Improved maintainability
   - Easier navigation
   - Direct context

2. Implementation Status:
   - ✅ Models tests moved to models/tests/
   - ✅ Routes tests moved to routes/tests/
   - ✅ Services tests moved to services/tests/
   - ✅ Test files renamed for clarity
   - ✅ Conftest.py files properly distributed

## Recent Changes

### Test Reorganization (2024-02-24 07:20 PST)
- Moved tests closer to implementation code
- Created dedicated test directories per module
- Updated imports and dependencies
- Renamed ProjectVersion to Version
- Identified database test setup issues

### Version Model Updates (2024-02-24 07:00 PST)
- Renamed ProjectVersion class to Version
- Updated all references to use new name
- Maintained existing functionality
- Preserved database schema

## Next Steps
1. Fix database test setup:
   - Research proper cascade deletion patterns
   - Implement robust cleanup mechanism
   - Add transaction management
   - Ensure test isolation

2. Improve test coverage:
   - Focus on critical paths first
   - Add missing test cases
   - Implement proper assertions
   - Document test patterns

3. Document learnings:
   - Update test setup guidelines
   - Record best practices
   - Document common pitfalls
   - Share solutions found
