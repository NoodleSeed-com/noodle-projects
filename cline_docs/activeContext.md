# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### OpenRouter Integration
- Implemented OpenRouter service for AI-powered code generation
- Added response validation and error handling
- Created comprehensive test suite for OpenRouter functionality
- Integrated with version management system

## Recent Changes

1. OpenRouter Service Implementation:
   - Added OpenRouter service with dependency injection
   - Implemented response validation with Pydantic models
   - Created test mocks and fixtures
   - Added test_openrouter.py for service testing

2. Response Format:
   - Implemented noodle_response tag validation
   - Added FileChange and AIResponse models
   - Created JSON schema validation
   - Added error handling for invalid responses

3. Testing:
   - Added OpenRouter service tests
   - Updated test organization:
     * OpenRouter integration (test_openrouter.py)
     * Service mocking (conftest.py)
     * Response validation
     * Error handling
   - Maintained 97% test coverage
   - All tests passing

## Active Decisions

1. Service Integration:
   - Using google/gemini-2.0-flash-001 model
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Dependency injection pattern
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. Response Handling:
   - Strict response format validation
   - Clear error messages
   - Proper JSON escaping
   - File path validation

## Next Steps

1. Potential Improvements:
   - Add response caching
   - Implement retry logic
   - Add rate limiting
   - Consider batch operations

2. Future Considerations:
   - Additional AI models
   - Enhanced error recovery
   - Performance optimization
   - Extended validation rules

## Current CLI Operations
- Run all tests: `cd api && pytest tests/ -v`
- Run OpenRouter tests: `pytest tests/test_projects/test_openrouter.py -v`
- Coverage check: `pytest --cov=api/app api/tests/ -v`
- All tests passing with 97% coverage
