# Product Context

## Purpose

The Projects API serves as a microservice for managing projects and their versions. It provides a RESTful interface for creating, updating, and retrieving project information, with a focus on version management without direct file manipulation endpoints.

## Core Functionality

### Project Management
- Create and manage projects with names and descriptions
- Track project status through an active flag
- Maintain project metadata including creation and update timestamps
- Support soft deletion to preserve project history

### Version Control
- Automatic version numbering within project scope
- Track latest version number for each project
- Support parent-child relationships between versions
- Version naming for human-readable identification

### File Storage
- Internal file storage associated with specific versions
- Enforce unique file paths within version scope
- No direct file manipulation through API
- Maintain file content and metadata

## Design Philosophy

### API First
- Clean, RESTful interface
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent response formats
- Proper error handling

### Data Integrity
- Required fields with meaningful defaults
- Unique constraints where appropriate
- Referential integrity through foreign keys
- Soft deletion for data preservation

### Performance
- Optimized database indexes
- Efficient version number tracking
- Async operations for scalability
- Connection pooling

## Use Cases

### Project Creation and Management
1. Create new projects with metadata
2. Update project information
3. List active projects
4. Retrieve specific project details
5. Soft delete projects when needed

### Version Management
1. Access version history
2. Retrieve specific versions
3. Track version relationships
4. Maintain version metadata

## Integration Points

### Database
- PostgreSQL via Supabase
- Async connection handling
- Transaction management
- Error handling

### Client Applications
- RESTful API endpoints
- JSON request/response format
- Pagination support
- Error reporting

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- No direct file access through API
- Soft deletion preserves history
- Required fields prevent data gaps
- Validation at all levels

### Database Security
- Row Level Security enabled
- Proper indexing for performance
- Cascade deletes where appropriate
- Unique constraints enforced

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Batch operations support
- Advanced version querying
- Additional metadata fields
- Enhanced search capabilities

### Scalability
- Current async design supports growth
- Database indexes for performance
- Connection pooling implemented
- Modular structure for extensions
