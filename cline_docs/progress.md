# Progress Update (02/23/2025 22:50 PST)

## Previously Resolved Test Failure
- **Test:** test_get_project in `api/tests/integration_tests/test_crud.py`
- **Error:** AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'status_code'
- **Resolution:** Converted the `test_get_project` function to an asynchronous function and applied `await` to the `client.post` and `client.get` calls.
- **Validation:** After applying the fix, running the test suite passed the affected test, with all integration tests now succeeding.

## Current Test Failure Investigation
- **Test:** test_partial_version_creation_rollback in `api/tests/unit_tests/test_edge_cases.py`
- **Error:** AttributeError: 'Project' object has no attribute 'files'
- **Root Cause:** Mock returning Project instead of ProjectVersion for version queries
- **Attempted Solutions:**
  1. Parameter-based mocking (too simplistic)
  2. Query string inspection (unreliable)
  3. Query structure inspection (too complex)
- **Decision:** After multiple attempts to fix the SQLAlchemy mocking approach, decided to:
  1. Research SQLAlchemy test patterns for complex queries
  2. Consider mock-alchemy library for better query mocking
  3. Evaluate moving complex query tests to integration tests
  4. Document query patterns and expected returns

## Next Steps
1. Research and evaluate mock-alchemy library
2. Review integration test patterns for complex SQLAlchemy queries
3. Document findings in research.md
4. Make decision on whether to:
   - Implement new mocking solution with mock-alchemy
   - Move complex query tests to integration tests
   - Or pursue alternative approach based on research findings
