     ```
     api/app/
     ├── models/
     │   ├── project.py
     │   └── tests/              # Model tests
 Eat     │       ├── conftest.py     # Model fixtures
     │       ├── test_project.py
     │       ├── test_version.py
     │       └── test_file.py
     ├── routes/
     │   ├── projects.py
     │   └── tests/              # Route tests
     │       ├── conftest.py     # Route fixtures
     │       ├── test_projects.py
     │       ├── test_versions.py
     │       └── test_concurrent.py
     └── services/
         ├── openrouter.py
         └── tests/              # Service tests
             ├── conftest.py     # Service fixtures
             └── test_openrouter.py
     ```
  2. Moved tests from api/tests/unit_tests/ to appropriate locations:
     * test_openrouter.py -> services/tests/
     * test_edge_cases.py -> split between routes/tests/ and models/tests/
     * test_inactive_project.py -> routes/tests/test_projects.py
     * test_version_changes.py -> routes/tests/test_versions.py
     * test_concurrent_operations.py -> routes/tests/test_concurrent.py
  3. Created module-specific conftest.py files with focused fixtures
  4. Updated documentation:
     * Added Testing Organization Pattern to systemPatterns.md
     * Updated project structure in .clinerules
     * Recorded changes in activeContext.md

  * Focused test scope

## Model Organization Improvement
- **Change:** Separated SQLAlchemy and Pydantic models into distinct layers
- **Implementation:**
  1. Created dedicated schema directory for Pydantic models:
     - `api/app/schemas/base.py`: Base Pydantic schema
     - `api/app/schemas/common.py`: Shared types and enums
     - `api/app/schemas/project.py`: Project API schemas
     - `api/app/schemas/version.py`: Version API schemas
     - `api/app/schemas/file.py`: File API schemas
  2. Reorganized SQLAlchemy models:
     - `api/app/models/base.py`: Base SQLAlchemy model
     - `api/app/models/project.py`: Project database model
     - `api/app/models/version.py`: Version database model
     - `api/app/models/file.py`: File database model
  3. Updated imports in:
     - `api/app/projects.py`: Now imports schemas for API layer
     - `api/app/crud.py`: Separated model and schema imports
- **Benefits:**
  - Clear separation of database and API concerns
  - Better organization of validation logic
  - Improved maintainability
  - Easier testing of each layer
  - Clear responsibility boundaries
- **Documentation:**
  - Updated .clinerules with new structure
  - Added Model Organization Pattern to systemPatterns.md
  - Recorded changes in activeContext.md

## Previously Resolved Test Failure
- **Test:** test_get_project in `api/tests/integration_tests/test_crud.py`
- **Error:** AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'status_code'
- **Resolution:** Converted the `test_get_project` function to an asynchronous function and applied `await` to the `client.post` and `client.get` calls.
- **Validation:** After applying the fix, running the test suite passed the affected test, with all integration tests now succeeding.

## Current Test Failure Investigation
- **Test:** test_partial_version_creation_rollback in `api/tests/unit_tests/test_edge_cases.py`
- **Error:** AttributeError: 'Project' object has no attribute 'files'
- **Root Cause:** Mock returning Project instead of Version for version queries
- **Attempted Solutions:**
  1. Parameter-based mocking (too simplistic)
  2. Query string inspection (unreliable)
  3. Query structure inspection (too complex)
- **Decision:** After multiple attempts to fix the SQLAlchemy mocking approach, decided to:
  1. Research SQLAlchemy test patterns for complex queries
  2. Consider mock-alchemy library for better query mocking
  3. Evaluate moving complex query tests to integration tests
  4. Document query patterns and expected returns
